Your are given a string. You must replace the word(s) coverage by covfefe, however, if you don't find the word coverage in the string, you must add covfefe at the end of the string with a leading space.

For the languages where the string is not immutable (such as ruby), don't modify the given string, otherwise this will break the test cases.
